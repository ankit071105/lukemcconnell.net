					<h5>Family First</h5>
					<hr class="card-line"><br>
					<article>
						<p>
							Since my last post my wife and I welcomed our second baby boy to the family. I put my job search on pause to focus on the birth and care of our newest family member. We are thrilled to have our new little guy here and I am grateful that everyone is healthy.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							On the computing front, I have been spending time with AWS, RabbitMQ, and working to harden my programming interview skills. I am also jumping back into my two development projects. Once I have achieved my personal objective with a respective project, I will present it in a way that makes sense.  This could be to package the application in an executable jar along with a demo video and documentation or perhaps host the application for use in some limited fashion.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Lastly, I am restarting my job search. The job market in Japan is unique. Prior to my recent son's birth, I did receive an offer for a contract position (Haken). I ended up declining the offer mainly because it would've required relocating. My family and I intend to stay in the Atami area if possible. Due to the nature of contract work being temporary and some skepticism of contract work in general, it didn't seem like the right move. 
						</p><br>
						<p>
							The next few blog posts will likely relate to my projects and any job related news. Stay tuned!

					<h5>Kicking off the blog</h5>
					<hr class="card-line"><br>
					<article>
						<p>
							I am starting the blog portion of this site to document some of my thoughts and opinions related to software development. I will intermittently include personal updates relating to my career.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							The <a href="dev.html" class="link">Dev</a> and <a href="about.html" class="link">About</a> sections of this website should provide a general sense of my experience in programming. I earned a B.S. in Computer Science from CU Boulder and worked 2 years as a software developer for the U.S. Air Force Civilian Service. I am also a hobbyist web and game developer.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							I relocated to Japan from the U.S. in July of 2022. This major life event required resigning from my position with the Air Force, establishing permanent residence, and moving family members and possessions. I am excited to be living in Japan for the second time in my life (I lived here during my active duty military years from 2013-2015).
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Currently, my main commitment is finding a new job. This means I'll be applying for openings and studying for programming interviews. I'll also be working on my messaging application Shoot Messenger and updating a few other projects in addition to searching for the correct position. The reason I plan to put effort into developing the Shoot Messenger is because it will display a wide array of software skills, including object-oriented programming, test-driven design, and the use of design patterns. Additionally, it could be a useful tool for integrating into future projects.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Thanks for checking out this blog. I aim to make some meaningful posts. Cheers!
