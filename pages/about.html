							Hi, I'm Luke McConnell. I am a B.S. Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, 
							graduating in August of 2020.
							I enjoy computer programing, computer animation and iterative design. I most frequently use Python and C++ programming languages. 
							I have had a successful undergraduate career in classes like Data Structures, Algorithms, Robotics, Data Science, and Artifical Intelligence. 
							I have also been on successful team projects that have produced deliverables greater than any individual.
							I have completed computer-related projects in a variety of langauges for wide array of purposes.
							Here are a few things I've done: 
							<ul>
								<li> Built 2 computers from indivudual parts sourced on the Internet. No kits, no build packages.</li>
								<li> Used code to actuate large stepper motors, linear actuators, and electric locks in sequence.</li>
								<li> Developed working map-based Android App with user authentication.</li>
								<li> Wrote a program to take user input and sift through large amounts of geoJSON data to create an HTML <a href=" https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/" target="_blank">Folium map</a> output.</li>
								<li> Created numerous small task Bash and Python scripts for automating processes and making API calls.</li>
