				Hi, I'm Luke McConnell. I work as a Computer Scientist for the Air Force Civilian Service. I've held this position since graduating with a B.S. Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder in August of 2020.
				My evolution from Nuclear Operations to Computer Science began with hobby-level Python programing in 2016. Since then, I've learned a tremendous amount about languages, interfaces, and software systems. I consider myself an ethusiatic technologist. 
				Over the last few years, I've enjoyed tinkering with computer animation, videography and photography. Check out some of my hobby work on the media page.
				One of the areas of my academic career I enjoyed most was Robotics and Artifical Intelligence. 
				Here are a few things I've done that show where I've come and where I'm going: 
				<ul>
					<li> Built 2 computers from indivudual parts sourced on the Internet. No kits, no build packages.</li>
					<li> Used code to actuate large stepper motors, linear actuators, and electric locks in sequence.</li>
					<li> Developed working map-based Android App with user authentication.</li>
					<li> Wrote a program to take user input and sift through large amounts of geoJSON data to create an HTML <a href=" https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/" target="_blank">Folium map</a> output.</li>
					<li> Created numerous small task Bash and Python scripts for automating processes and making API calls.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I am also a U.S. Navy Veteran. I served 6 years as a 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinist%27s_mate#Nuclear_mechanics" target="_blank">Nuclear Machinist's Mate.</a>
				I was forward deployed out of Yokosuka, Japan for 3 years.
				During this time I visited Australia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, Guam, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and the Phillipines.
				I gained a vast experience in nuclear engineering operations and maintenance.
				After 4 deployments, my contract came to a close and I was honorably discharged.
				I am working to showcase my experiences and qualifications on this online portfolio.
				My current resume is posted below. Thanks for visting!
