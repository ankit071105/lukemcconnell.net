            <p>
                The software development ventures I have taken on for personal use have varied in scope. 
                I have enjoyed working on home projects from a simple LED controlling bash script, 
                to a python program that sifted through financial data to produce custom D3 visualizations. 
                I also made a scrolling video game with the Javascript library Phaser, 
                where I used some custom sprite sheets to created a hostile environment for the player to overcome.
                I have stored some of this on my Github, but others I have intentionally kept in offline repositories.
                Since Github is a way to view and measure an individuals skills, I plan to contribute more as time goes on.
                To show some of what I've made for strictly web, I will be embedding some code pens into this site. 
                This is just the beginning!
            </p>

        <div class="page-content page-content-dev-2">
            <h2 id="Professional">Professional</h2>
            <p>
                Since I began working as a Software Developer, I have completed a number of assignments in a variety of languages.
                <br><br>
                I designed and built a software installation script in Powershell for my first asignment. 
                The script functioned is launched by double-clicking on an icon within the installation CD.
                It began by disabling a number of running Microsoft services and detaching multiple databases from MSSQL Server.
                Then it copied files over from the CD into specific directories on the computer. 
                Lastly, the script restarted the computer, reattched the databases and enabled the services.
                <br><br>
                Next I contributed to a ASP.NET Razor Pages web site. 
                I created stories and pushed code to an Azure DevOps repository. 
                On this project I used C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Regex.
                My contributions added additional front-end and back-end functionalities. 
                <br><br>
                Recently, I studied, designed, and delivered an enterprise-level software design proposal. 
                The project has since transitioned into development which is ongoing. 
                I feel like it is an especially valuable experience to work as a developer on a large software project I helped to design. 
                The product is an instantiable containerized software. 
                Each instance is able to accept unique data streams from a source via TCP/IP connection 
                The data streams are then parsed into messages and then published to a message broker (like ActiveMQ).
                An instance is also able to recieve messages as a subscriber, reconstruct the messages to a data stream 
                and send the stream to a recipient system via TCP/IP.
                The intent is to allow for a third-party to create subscribers to recieve standardized messages intended for a variety of recipients. 
                A goal of the enterprise serice is to remain tecnology stack independent. 
                One part of this is to use an API wrapper for the message broker that allows for using one standard 
                for a number of messaging services. There is essentially two main development efforts. 
                The first portion of development will focus on creating the message passing infrastructure 
                to accept and send data streams, create messages, and interact with the message broker.
                The second effort is to work with each recipient system's unique message formats 
                to accurately parse data streams into messages and back, while maintaining data integrity.

        <div class="page-content page-content-dev-3">
            <h2 id="Open_Source">Freelance & Open Source</h2>
            <p>
                While I haven't contributed to any Open Source projects yet, I have created this area of the site 
                to hold my accountable and follow through with my desire to do so. I have researched and connected with
                the code base of a block-chain technology I plan to work with. I will update the site when I have 
                contributed something noteworthy. 
                I can see working with the one project I have in mind, but beyond that will likely focus on paid work.
                <br> <br>
                I haven't begun taking on freelance work. I plan to do this once I have a larger online presence.
                This will probably be one of the last areas of the site to be updated based on my priorities. 
                However, my ambition for freelance work makes this an inevitability in my mind. 
                I'll report back when progress has been made. Hopefully, this will span into its own section of the site.
