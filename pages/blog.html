							Since my last post I have been searching for positions in Japan that are remote or offer hybrid options. When communicating with recruiters or applying for positions, I have maintained that if there was a truly good fit I would be willing to relocate. I've changed my stance on this based on recent experience.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							After my very first interview I received a job offer. The company was recognizable. The salary offered was respectable. The team lead seemed to be a good individual to work for and learn from. However, the position required relocating in the near future. I declined to accept the position. I concluded that for this particular job, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. Beyond the inconvenience of the initial move, there is the continued time lost to commuting, office antics, and the potential feelings of surveillance and micromanagement. Additionally, I've noticed a continuous listing of similar opportunities that are fully work-from-home.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Reflecting on this experience has helped me realize that I should pursue a primarily remote position. While working from home is not a good fit for everyone, I know my best, most efficient work occurs when I have dedicated hours of uninterrupted time in my home work space.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							I do believe lasting relationships, specifically of the mentor/mentee nature, are often best forged in person. However, once a level of competence is reached, the office workplace can be an antiquated model. Of course there are many situations where a position needs to be on-site. Yet there are just as many occasions when work can be satisfactorily completed from home.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							I've learned from my intercultural marriage that a commitment to communication is necessary for success. I believe a similar commitment to communication is how remote teams are able to successfully develop quality software with a cohesive ethic. A key ingredient for any successful endeavor is communication. I will now be searching for opportunities that are exclusively remote, bringing my abilities to collaboratively work to the best suited position.

					<h5>Kicking off the blog</h5>
					<hr class="card-line"><br>
					<article>
						<p>
							I am starting the blog portion of this site to document some of my thoughts and opinions related to software development. I will intermittently include personal updates relating to my career.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							The <a href="dev.html" class="link">Dev</a> and <a href="about.html" class="link">About</a> sections of this website should provide a general sense of my experience in programming. I earned a B.S. in Computer Science from CU Boulder and worked 2 years as a software developer for the U.S. Air Force Civilian Service. I am also a hobbyist web and game developer.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							I relocated to Japan from the U.S. in July of 2022. This major life event required resigning from my position with the Air Force, establishing permanent residence, and moving family members and possessions. I am excited to be living in Japan for the second time in my life (I lived here during my active duty military years from 2013-2015).
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Currently, my main commitment is finding a new job. This means I'll be applying for openings and studying for programming interviews. I'll also be working on my messaging application Shoot Messenger and updating a few other projects in addition to searching for the correct position. The reason I plan to put effort into developing the Shoot Messenger is because it will display a wide array of software skills, including object-oriented programming, test-driven design, and the use of design patterns. Additionally, it could be a useful tool for integrating into future projects.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							Thanks for checking out this blog. I aim to make some meaningful posts. Cheers!
