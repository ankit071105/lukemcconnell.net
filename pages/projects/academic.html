					<p>
						This five-person interdisciplinary team endeavor derived from a problem posed to us by the NGA in an
						entrepreneurial setting.
						The ultimate goal was to produce dual-purpose (military and private-sector) entity use-cases.
						In short, the NGA wanted us to develop a software solution to identify salient changes in mass
						quantities of geoJSON data and transform it into actionable information.<br>
						<br>
						This data came from the European Space Agency's (ESA)
						<a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1" target="_blank"
							class="link">Sentienel-1 mission</a>.
						The mission is comprised of a constellation of two polar-orbiting C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
						satellites.
						The data we were given was preprocessed by the NGA's internal change-detection algorithm.
						What we recieved was a 700+ GB of geoJSON and KMZ files.<br>
						<br>
						We worked as a team to develop two code-backed approaches to handing the Sentienel-1 SAR data, namely
						heatmapping and clustering.
						However, based on the low resolution of Sentienel-1 data compared to emerging technologies, which offer
						a magnitude increase in resolution,
						it was a tough case to sell for private-sector use. <br>
						<br>
						Therefore, we gave the NGA our code and a thoughtful detailed write-up that explained the problem and
						landscape as we came to know it.
						This lead to our team to a major pivot to focus on wildfire mitigation.
						We landed on this focus largely due to the fact that SAR data is unique in its ability acquire imagery
						regardless of the weather.
						In order to make a case for an entrepreneurial endeavor, we conducted interviews, market research, and
						establied industry partners.
						The video on this page stands as a testament to the deep dive we took into this realm.

					<p>
						In place of the traditional Computer Science Capstone project, I applied for CU Boulder's Capstone
						Exchange program.
						I wanted to work on an interdisciplinary team in the Mechanical Engineering Capstone, called Senior
						Design.
						After I was in the program, I then applied and was accepted for this specific project.<br>
						<br>
						The team was comprised of seven Mechanical Engineering students, and myself being the sole Computer
						Science student.
						We were given a prompt by the ARO titled "<i>Autonomous device/system for ground-based Warfighter
							protection, supply, and/or evacuation</i>".
						This amounted to a largely open-ended design and prototyping project.
						We spent the entire Fall 2019 semester developing the scope, design, manufacturing, assembly, and test
						plans for the project.
						This included drawing up industry standard documents and presentations such as the Critical Design
						Review.
						The lionshare of the team's time during Spring 2020 semester was spent putting together and testing our
						device.<br>
						<br>
						My role as the team Computer Scientist was broadly split in two.
						Firstly, I was to research, pitch, make diagrams, and field questions during the iterative design
						process
						to aid in determining scope and feasibility.
						Secondly I was to taking the lead with computer and electronics hardware installation, software
						implementation, and testing.<br>
						<br>
						Part of this process included using Python's Computer Vision module OpenCV with a webcam attached to our
						device.
						This was to autonomously detect some visual target, find its location, and deploy defensive system in
						response.
						In order to accomplish this, we used a Raspberry Pi with Raspian (Debian-based operating system) as the
						computer for the electronic components interface with.
						The webcam was plugged into the Raspberry Pi's USB port, while the rest of the components were connected
						via the general purpose input/output ports.
						Below is a diagram I made of the electronics, a sample of what the computer vision code would "see", and
						a couple images of the device.
						The code for the final program can be found <a
							href="https://github.com/lrmcc/ARO-Senior-Design/blob/master/SDET_FINAL.py" target="_blank"
							class="link">here</a> and
						the project is also on the University of Colorado Boulder website found <a

					<h2>Bebop Parrot 2 Path Planner</h2>
					<p>
						This robotics project was a four-person team effort during the Fall 2019 semester.
						We decided to write a color-coded path planner via blob detection for a quadcopter.
						My contributions entailed installing and managing the ROS middleware on an Ubunutu Linux virtual machine
						and aquiring the required Bebop packages.
						I setup the initial quadcopter communications, which were basic controlling movement via bash commands.
						I then wrote the same type of commands in Python and merged it with the groups blob-detection code.
						We then worked as a group to bring together and test the color-detection and motor controlling. The code
						can be found <a href="https://github.com/lrmcc/RoboticsFinal" target="_blank">here.</a>
						The video below was part of our group's deliverable.

					<h2>PickUp/Pindown App</h2>
					This project began as a six-person team in the Spring of 2019 in Software Development Methods and Tools
					class.
					The team designed and implemented a working Android app prototype named PickUp.
					The name is from the common term for an impromptu sports game, which was the types of events we were
					targeting.
					The app was created using Google's Flutter SDK with a Firebase database and Google Cloud Platform for user
					authentication.
					My chief contributions to the app protoype were establishing the authentication and
					required API keys as well as connecting Firebase to the frontend. The team used weekly Scrum meetings and a
					broader interative Agile methodology throughout the semester.
					The team was successful in developing a protoype version
					<a href="https://github.com/lrmcc/PickUpApp1.0/tree/master/lib/pages" target="_blank" class="link">
						found here</a>
					that allowed users to create an account, securely login, and post and remove events at predetermined
					locations on a map.<br>
					<br>
					This project gave rise to efforts to rebrand and build a new start-up around map-based events app, called
					Pindown.
					This startup went on to grow and pitch at the 2020 <a href=" https://www.colorado.edu/nvc/" target="_blank"
						class="link"> New Venture Challenge</a>.
					It has since dissolved. Below is some images from PickUp that were remade into wireframes for Pindown.
